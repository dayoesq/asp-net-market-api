## 1. Introduction

The E-Commerce Web API is a RESTful web service built using ASP.NET. It provides a set of endpoints to manage various aspects of an e-commerce platform, such as products, orders, customers, and authentication. This API serves as the backend for an e-commerce website or mobile application.

## 2. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using the E-Commerce Web API, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (for development)
- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (for running the API)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (for database storage)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/dayoesq/asp-net-market-api.git
    ```

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.

3. Configure the connection string in the `appsettings.json` file to point to your SQL Server database.

4. Run the following commands in the Package Manager Console to create the database schema and seed initial data:

    ```shell
    Update-Database
    ```

5. Build and run the application.

## 3. Configuration

- **appsettings.json**: Contains configuration settings for the application, including the database connection string, JWT authentication settings, and other application-specific options.

## 4. Usage

### Authentication

The E-Commerce Web API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. To access protected endpoints, you must obtain a valid JWT token by logging in.

### Endpoints

The API provides various endpoints for managing e-commerce data. Here are some of the core endpoints:

- `/api/v1/products`: CRUD operations for products.
- `/api/v1/orders`: Create and manage orders.
- `/api/v1/customers`: Manage customer profiles.
- `/api/v1/auth`: User authentication and registration.

For a complete list of endpoints and their documentation, refer to the API documentation or explore the codebase.

### Sample Requests

Here are some sample API requests using `curl`:

**Register a new user:**

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}' http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/register
```

**Login and obtain a JWT token:**

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}' http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/login
```

**Create a new product (requires authentication):**

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" -d '{
  "name": "Product Name",
  "price": 19.99,
  "description": "Product description"
}' http://localhost:5000/api/v1/products
```

## 5. Security

Security is crucial for any e-commerce application. Here are some security considerations:

- Always use HTTPS to encrypt data transmission.
- Implement rate limiting and authentication mechanisms to prevent abuse.
- Keep the API and all dependencies up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Use strong and secure passwords for user accounts.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive endpoints.

## 6. Testing

Unit tests and integration tests are essential for maintaining the reliability of the API. You can run tests using the testing framework of your choice, such as MSTest or xUnit.
